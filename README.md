## Project Description

Our team has been tasked with assisting a Fintech lender in developing a new explainable credit scorecard to evaluate credit applicants. The lender, specializing in serving unbanked and underbanked individuals, aims to expand its services to a broader customer base, particularly targeting the age group of 40-44 due to their historically low default rates. 
This project involves analyzing a sample set of customer credit data to identify a new customer segment and develop a credit scorecard tailored to their needs.
